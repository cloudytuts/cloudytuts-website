    Learn how to implement nested namespaces in Kubernetes using the new Hierarchical Namespaces resource type, and move away from two-dimensional resource organization.
---

Namespaces are way of organizing resources into common groups. The limitation up until now has been the flat, two-dimensional hierarchy of namespaces. 

Unfortunately, at the time of writing this tutorial, hierarchical namespaces are not a built-in feature of Kubernetes or kubectl. Instead, it is available as an extension to be installed on your cluster, which an accompanying plugin for kubectl.

## Install Hierarchical Namespaces
Hierarchical namespaces requires a new controller to be installed on your cluster(s). The controller yaml is available from the [multi-tenancy](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/releases) repository of Kubernetes' [kubernetes-sigs](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs) project.

### Controller
```shell
HNC_VERSION=v0.5.1
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/releases/download/hnc-${HNC_VERSION}/hnc-manager
```

### Kubectl Plugin
```shell
HNC_VERSION=v0.5.1
curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/releases/download/hnc-${HNC_VERSION}/kubectl-hns -o ./kubectl-hns
chmod +x ./kubectl-hns

# Ensure the plugin is working
kubectl hns
# The help text should be displayed
```



## Creating Hierarchical Namespaces
The `kubectl` CLI includes a new command named `hns`, or hierarchical Namespace for short. When used against an existing namespace the new hns namespace will be nested underneath it.

For example, the following creates a nested namespace named **production** under an existing namespace named **myapp**.

```shell
kubectl hns create production -n myapp
```

## Hierarchical Namespace Trees
To help engineers find their way through a nest of namespaces, a very helpful `tree` subcommand has been included with the new `hns` command. 

```shell
kubectl hns tree myapp
```
    | Output
```text
myapp
└── production
```
