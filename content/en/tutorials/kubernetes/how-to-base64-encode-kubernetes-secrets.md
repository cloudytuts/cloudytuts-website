    Learn how to encode and decode Kubernetes secrets using the base64 command in Linux and OSX.
---

Kubernetes secrets allow us to segregate our secret and sensitive information from our resources. Instead of storing the data as clear text inside of, for example, a Pod manifest we can add a place holder that is replaced by Kubernetes when the Pod is created.

Kubernetes stores secrets as base64 encoded strings and encrypts the data on disk. In order to save a secret in Kubernetes it must be converted to a base64 string.

As an example, if the following string were the password for our database
```text
super-secret-password
```

It would look like the following when base64 encoded:
```text
c3VwZXItc2VjcmV0LXBhc3N3b3Jk
```

## Secrets Manifest
Secrets are populated in Kubernetes using Secrets resources. The following is an example of a Secrets manifest.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secrets
metadata:
  name: example-secrets
data:
  DB_PASSWORD: c3VwZXItc2VjcmV0LXBhc3N3b3Jk
  DB_USER: ZGVtby1hcHAx
```

Notice the values for `DB_PASSWORD` and `DB_USER`. The values are actually base64 encoded strings, which is how Kubernetes stores secrets in its database. When creating a Secrets manifest you must base64 encode your string values.

## Base64 Encode Secrets
Base64 encoding a string in **OSX** and **Linux** can be done from the shell. Both operating systems typically come bundled with the `base64` command line tool.

In order to convert a string into a valid base64 encoded string using the base64 command, we echo the string and pipe the output to the base64 command. The `-n` flag set for `echo` ensures only the characters within the commas will be encoded.

```shell
echo -n 'super-secret-password' | base64
```
    | Output
```shell
c3VwZXItc2VjcmV0LXBhc3N3b3Jk
```

{{< warning >}}
Always remember to set the `-n` flag for `echo` when encoding secrets. The flag prevents trailing newline characters from being encoded. Hidden characters in base64 encoded secrets will result in improperly formed strings, which will cause you grief with Kubernetes.

## Using stringData
For those who wish not to encode values as base64 encoded string first, an alternative is to use the `stringData` key instead of the `data` key in your manifest. The `stringData` key allows us to store our secrets as plain text in the file.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secrets
metadata:
  name: example-secrets
stringData:
  DB_PASSWORD: "super-secret-password"
  DB_USER: "demo-app1"
```
